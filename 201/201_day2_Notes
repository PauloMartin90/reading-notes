- JavaScript uses an object oriented language this is great because you can fill a object with pertainent information
- The downside of this is when it is a global variable it takes up memory when loading the page
- The other side of this coin is we can use do loops to fill these objects and take that information and use a call function for the specific information needed.
- When writing and array could I use that array to fill a function?
- When writing a function can I fill it with variables or character data only?
- Couldn't I just build a website using nothing but call functions do loops to make the html and css on the page?\\


DO Loops what can I use them for?

**for loop**
counting
calculations
