The most important thing to remember is what is the information of that person name, age, gender, profession, location, income, occupation,web usage and if it is personal/professional. This meta data is important to know when it comes to creating the website for the community the developer would like to service.

### Why people visit your site?
Knowing what the site is used for is an important question to answe such as does the community of people you want to service with your site visit because of general entertainment or specific goal, essential or luxury and personal or professional use. Is there any specific goals your site completes such as does it give general information or particular fact, familiar knowledge or learning about
and could it be time sensitive news or particular update.

## HTML vs HTML5
	- HTML would use the <div> for everything
	- HTML5 does not need it for header, article, aside, footer

Header are meant to contain the site name and something eye grabbing
Footer is for copyright
Navigation is for the addresses for the bar
articles are written inside the the **<div>** Content section
aside give you a side bar

Heading groups <hgroup> group together headings from h1-h6
<section>
