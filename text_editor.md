# Text Editor Notes

## What is a Text Editor?
Are unique tool to programmers where one flavor isn't always meant for everyone. Text editors do exactly what they are named to do edit the text to make suggestion, corrections and bring useful commands the prgrammer may need. Text editor enviroments can be change for the language the programmer is using providing suggestions and corrections needed to launch the code successfully. The birghtness of text editors can be changed to better suit the programmer by using different contrast is characters and backgrounds.

## What do you look for in a text editor?
With different types of text editor what are the key features that make them unique from one another are the use of them for:

1. code completion; 
1. syntax highlighting; 
1. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); 
1. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.


## What is a IDE Text Editor? 
These are different types of editors an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. With cellular phones being mobile computers we can use the different resources on a phone to create new types of applications. The IDE allows us not to rebuild the wheel but use exisiting code to use the resources of the phone with out having to create new code.

## Terminal
A terminal or command line is a text based interface to the system. Programmers will input commands and an output is given by the computer. There are different types of terminals for each operating system. There is a shell that is part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will react to commands search for running commands for the programmer. There are a variety of shells available but the most common is called "Bash". To see what shell you're using you may use a command called "echo" to display a system variable stating your current shell.

## Navigation
The navigation of your terminal is important by using commands such as **PWD** (print working directory) the programmer can find their enviroment they are working in. Searching the files with in the directory is by using the **ls** list command that shows all the files in the directory. 

#### Paths:
There are two types of paths absolute and relative. Paths start at the root directory, or the main folder, and each sub folder follows a forward slash (/) . Absolute paths show the entire pathway and relative path show files in relation to where you currently are in you system. Some other ways to build paths include:
1. tild (~): shortcuts to your home directory
1. dot (.): shows you your current directory
1. dotdot (..): references the parent directory

## Files
With any computer operating system under the hood and in the kernal, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only). To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.

### Commands
| Definition |  Syntax  |
| -------| ------------------ |
| pwd | print working directory which will show you the current folder you are in |
| ls | list files in the current directory |
| ls -a | list all files in a directory including hidden files |
| ~ | shortcut for home directory|
| .. | reference to parent directory |
| cd | change directory and is usually followed by a path you want to target |
| file | shows the file type and data associated with the file specified |
