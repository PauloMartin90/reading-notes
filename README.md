### About Me
Hiya! My name is Paulo Martin, Iâ€™m an environmentalist from Humboldt county. During the pandemic I was going to Humboldt State University working towards my environmental resource engineering degree. Since everything has gone online, I wanted to put down that path for now and work on a project that impacts the environment through coding. While going to school I worked for an outdoor recreation program on campus helping Military Veterans transition to school through the outdoors. Before going to California to go to University I enlisted in the US Army as a canon crew member I was stationed in South Korea at a Field Artilllery in Camp Casey. One of my major roles I served for the unit was the Company Armorer where I maintained, serviced, secured and recorded company weaponry/equipment for my company of 250 soldiers. After serving I spent time working in the Philippines trading bitcoins at local exchanges and working on a networking algorithms to create a mesh network.

### Growth Mindset

Obstacles
: In participation and focus we find instant gratification by completing a task by diverting attention to small
task that will not help us through our task at hand such as watching a video, sipping coffee or even playing a game. We persist through these task as growth minded thinkers and persist on the task at hand to gain better knowledge on our overall goal.

Critism
: Self reflection is the open and honest conversation we have with ourselves. By allowing where we reached our goals and where we faulter we can analyze our own strength and weaknesses tending to what we need to focus on to better our overall skill set.

Success of Others
: We as humans find that there is a tendancy to jealously for other accomplishments. By changing that mindset to what our peers can teach us we find more answers to question we have unanswered. Asking for help isn't weakness but it is the practice of solving our faults and striving on.
