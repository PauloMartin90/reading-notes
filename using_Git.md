# Using Git

## Version Control
Version Control is a system that records changes and allows programmers to revisit various versions of a file or set of files. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

## Local Version Control
Local Version control procedures were done using hard disk centralizing updates with only one person reviewing all changes before the push.

## Centralized Version Control
The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This allowed teams of developers to work with one another in tandem on a project. This way one central operations manager would review all the changes before pushing code out. This is a common way how businesses operate at the moment at one centralized server.

## Distributed Version Control
A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. Just like how mesh networks found in offices and homes to address and improve overall connectivity is implemented. Such is done in a distriuted network of version control is done. One example of that is how bitcoin mining used on a decentralized network for any real signicant change to be made on the network protocols 51% of all miners need to be update to the newer version creating a fork in the mining program with a different set of rules.

To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information. Such as keeping the blockchain records up to date.


## Local Operations

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a projectâ€™s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

## Tracking Changes
Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

## Loss of Data
Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.


Definition | Syntax
---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
States     | Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
Committed  | Data is securely stored in a local database
Modified   | File has been changed but not committed to the database
