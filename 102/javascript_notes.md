# Javascript Notes


## Introduction
Javascript is a behaivor language that allows different operations to be down with in the HTML framework. THis could be done but assigning variables this can include but limiting to : User actions, calculations or different assortment of functions built in. 

## Declaring a function
For example a function can be broken down using the key word **function** and procceding the *function name*. Then a curly brace is opened to initiate the function actions and code is written inside this block

> **function** *sayHello()* {
> document.write('Hello!');   
> }

## Arithemetic Operator

| Name | Operator | Purpose & Notes | Example | Result |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| addition | + | Adds one value to another |10 + 5 | 15 |
| Subtraction | - | Subtracts one value from another | 10 - 5 | 5 |
| Division | / | Divides tow values | 10 / 5 | 2 |
| Multiplication | * | Multiplies two values using an asterisk (Note that this is not the letter x) | 10*5 | 50 |
| Increment | ++ | Adds one to the current number | i =10; i++; | 11 |
| Decrement | -- | Subtracts one from the current number | i = 10; i--; | 11|
Modulus | Divides two values and returns the remainder | 10 % 3 | 1 |

| Syntax | Meaning | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| == | is equal to | This operator compares two values (numbers, string, or booleans) to see f they are the same |
| != | is not equal to | This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same |
| === | strict equal to | This operator two values to check that both the data type and calue are the same |
| !== | strict not equal to | This operator compares tow values to check that both the data type and value are not the same |
| > | greater than | This operator checks if the number on the left is *greater* than the number on the right |
| < | lesst than | This operator checks if the number on the left is *less* than the number on the right
| >= | greater than or equal to | This operator checks if the number on the left is *greater* than or equal to the number on the right |
| <= | less than or equal to | This operator checks if the number on the left is *less* than or equal to the number on the right |


## Loops
| Syntax | Definition |
| :---: | :---: |
| FOR | If you need to run code a specific number of times use, a **for** loop. (it is the most common loop.) In a **for** loop, condisiton is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run. |
| WHILE | If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a **while** loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true. |
| DO WHILE | The **do...while** loop is very similar to the **while** loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluate to false. |
| Initialization | Create a variable and set it to **0**. This variable is commonly called i, and it acts as the counter. |
| Condition | The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number. |
| Update | Everytime the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter. |

Loops are useful to iterate code
